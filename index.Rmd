Hi! My name is Pradeeti Mainali. I am currently a second year student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I am pursuing an MPH in Epidemiology with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science, which I will complete in May 2025.

I also graduated from the University of Virginia in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Arts in Global Studies, Public Health.
